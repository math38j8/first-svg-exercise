        <!-- RECTANGLE -->
        <!-- The <rect> element draws a rectangle on the screen. 
            There are 6 basic attributes that control the position and shape of the rectangles on screen. 
            The one on the right has its rx and ry parameters set, giving it rounded corners. 
            If they're not set, they default to 0.-->
            <rect class="rectangle" x="10" y="10" width="30" height="30" stroke="black"  stroke-width="5"/>
            <rect class="rectangle move"  x="60" y="10" rx="10" ry="10" width="30" height="30" stroke="black"  stroke-width="5"/>
       
        <!-- x  
            The x position of the top left corner of the rectangle. -->

        <!-- y
            The y position of the top left corner of the rectangle. -->

        <!-- width
            The width of the rectangle -->

        <!-- height
            The height of the rectangle -->

        <!-- rx
            The x radius of the corners of the rectangle -->

        <!-- ry
            The y radius of the corners of the rectangle  -->
      

        <!-- CIRCLE -->
        <!-- The <circle> element draws a circle on the screen. 
            It takes 3 basic parameters to determine the shape and size of the element. -->
        <g fill="yellow">
            <circle  class="orange" cx="25" cy="75" r="20"  stroke-width="5"/>
        </g>
        <!-- r
            The radius of the circle. -->

        <!-- cx
            The x position of the center of the circle. -->

        <!-- cy
            The y position of the center of the circle. -->


        <!-- ELLIPSE -->
        <!-- An <ellipse> is a more general form of the <circle> element, 
            where you can scale the x and y radius 
            (commonly referred to as the semimajor and semiminor axes in maths) of the circle separately. -->
        <ellipse class ="ellipse" cx="75" cy="75" rx="20" ry="5" stroke="red" fill="transparent" stroke-width="5"/>

        <!-- rx
            The x radius of the ellipse. -->

        <!-- ry
            The y radius of the ellipse. -->

        <!-- cx
            The x position of the center of the ellipse. -->

        <!-- cy
            The y position of the center of the ellipse. -->

      

        <!-- LINE -->
        <!-- The <line> element takes the positions of two points as parameters 
            and draws a straight line between them. -->
        <line class="orange" x1="10" x2="50" y1="110" y2="150"  stroke-width="5"/>
        
        <!-- x1
            The x position of point 1. -->


        <!-- y1
            The y position of point 1. -->

        <!-- x2
            The x position of point 2. -->

        <!-- y2
            The y position of point 2. -->



        <!-- POLYLINE -->
        <!-- A <polyline> is a group of connected straight lines. 
            Since the list of points can get quite long, all the points are included in one attribute: -->
        <polyline points="60 110 65 120 70 115 75 130 80 125 85 140 90 135 95 150 100 145"
            stroke="orange" fill="transparent" stroke-width="5"/>
        <polyline points="100, 200 180, 120 200, 200 250, 150 "
            stroke="orange" fill="transparent" stroke-width="5"/>

        <!-- points
            A list of points. Each number must be separated by a space, comma, EOL, or a line feed character. 
            Each point must contain two numbers: an x coordinate and a y coordinate. 
            So, the list (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2) would be written as 0, 0 1, 1 2, 2. -->

      

        <!-- POLYGON -->
        <!-- A <polygon> is similar to a <polyline>, 
            in that it is composed of straight line segments connecting a list of points. 
            For polygons though, the path automatically connects the last point with the first, 
            creating a closed shape. -->
        <polygon  class="blue star" points="50 160 55 180 70 180 60 190 65 205 50 195 35 205 40 190 30 180 45 180" stroke-width="5"/>
        <polygon class="yellow" points="225, 100 300, 190 260, 300 200, 300 150, 200" stroke-width="12"/>

        <!--points
            A list of points, each number separated by a space, comma, EOL, or a line feed character. 
            Each point must contain two numbers: an x coordinate and a y coordinate. 
            So, the list (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2) would be written as 0, 0 1, 1 2, 2. 
            The drawing then closes the path, so a final straight line would be drawn from (2,2) to (0,0). -->
      

        <!-- PATH -->
        <!-- A <path> is the most general shape that can be used in SVG. 
            Using a path element, you can draw rectangles (with or without rounded corners), 
            circles, ellipses, polylines, and polygons. 
            Basically any of the other types of shapes, bezier curves, quadratic curves, and many more. -->
        <path class="path1" d="M20,230 Q40,205 50,230 T90,230" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="5"/>
        <path class="path2" d="M10,300 Q40,400 50,300 T250,400 T100, 300" fill="none" stroke="lime" stroke-width="5"/>
        <path d="M225, 100 L300, 190 L260, 300 L200, 300 L150, 200 L225, 100" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="5"/>
        <path d="M225, 100 Q300, 190 260, 300 C200, 300 150, 200 225, 100" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="5"/>


        <!-- d
            A list of points and other information about how to draw the path -->

        <!-- m
            that moves the pen without drawing -->

        <!-- L, H, V, Z 
            for drawing straight lines -->

        <!-- C, S, Q, T 
            for drawing curves lines -->

        <!-- A
            for drawing 'arcs' - a partial ellipse from one point to another -->

        <!-- Uppercase
            means that the coordinates are absolute (relative to top left corner) -->

        <!-- Lowercase
            means that the coordinates are relative (to the last position of the pen) -->
